      Robin McLaurin Williams was a kind man with a tragic ending, letting
      others know that no matter how happy people are, everyone goes through
      struggles that no one else notices. The actor has taught many valuable
      lessons, he is one of the greatest actors/voice actors of all time. An
      American actor and comedian. Known for his improvisational skills and the
      wide variety of characters he created on the spur of the moment and
      portrayed on film, in dramas and comedies alike, he is regarded as one of
      the greatest comedians of all time. In 1978, ABC caught wind of Robin
      Williams' act and were so impressed that they fast-tracked a new sitcom in
      which he'd play an alien. Though critics were initially skeptical about
      the premise, “Mork & Mindy” was a phenomenal hit and launched Robin
      Williams' incredibly successful career.

      While Robin Williams didn't have a massive career in voice acting, the
      characters he inhabited will forever echo in animation. In the same year
      the actor voiced the mischievous Genie, Williams also transformed into
      Batty Koda in "Ferngully: The Last Rainforest" (via IMDb). Not only was he
      the ultimate sidekick to Samantha Mathis' Crysta the fairy, but performed
      the "Batty Rap" that was in every '90s kids head for a while (via
      YouTube).

    <h1>His Kindness</h1>
    <p>
      August 11, 2014, was a dark day for many when the world lost the light
      that was Robin Williams. Known for his chaotic energy and caring soul,
      Williams played countless roles that were beloved by audiences. While not
      often commented on during his life, Williams was an avid supporter of
      charitable causes, donating and serving over 50 charities and causes at
      the time of his death. His money may have been spread among dozens of
      locations and causes, but his time spent in these memorable charities
      really spoke to his caring and considerate soul. One of Robin Williams'
      most public supports went to the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.
      Williams proudly volunteered time, money, and service to support the
      children's hospital, even appearing in commercials and announcements for
      the organization in 2004.

      Robin Williams may have come across as public and extroverted, however,
      the comedian kept a lot of things close to his chest. One such secret took
      place between 2004 and 2008 when the actor raised close to $50, 000 for a
      Seattle food bank without saying a word. Rather than flaunt his donations
      and assistance to the food bank, Williams went on to donate proceeds from
      his 2007 and 2008 shows directly to the organization to do his part to
      help those in need.

      Robin Williams kind spirit extends beyond existing charities. Wanting to
      do more than just provide personal donations, Williams and his second
      wife, Marsha Williams, came together to found the Windfall Foundation. The
      organization exists to serve other causes, extending finances and finding
      grants for a variety of causes. Raising funding for Doctors Without
      Borders, Make-A-Wish Foundation, Pediatric Aids Association, Project Open
      Hand, and many more, the Windfall Foundation serves to support charitable
      causes in need.
